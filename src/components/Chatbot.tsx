    year: "3rd year",
    course: "Computer Science and Engineering (CSE)",
    specialization: "Internet of Things (IoT)",
    background: "I'm a passionate UI/UX Designer and Webflow Developer with a keen eye for creating exceptional digital experiences that bridge the gap between beautiful design and functional technology.",
    approach: "My approach combines creative thinking with technical expertise to deliver results that exceed expectations.",

    quirks: "I have this weird relationship with CSS where I love it but also want to throw my laptop sometimes. And honestly, I think every bug is just a feature that hasn't been properly documented yet.",
    workStyle: "I code like I cook - throw in some ingredients, taste it, adjust, and hope it doesn't explode. Sometimes it's a masterpiece, sometimes it's a learning experience (that's what I tell myself anyway).",
    humor: "I make dad jokes about coding, laugh at my own debugging fails, and believe that if you can't laugh at your code, you're taking life too seriously.",
    dailyLife: "My typical day: wake up, code, debug, lunch, code, debug, dinner, maybe more coding.",
